use this  enviornment variable :
      MYSQL_DATABASE: 'super-app'
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: 'password'
don't forget to use ports : 3306



now you have the node application ready for you 
the port of the application is : 3000

write the docker compose file
the application is not really connecting to DB
